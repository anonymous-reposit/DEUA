### How to run case studies?
The main.py file is the entry programm.

### Datasets
* Our experiments are based on two datasets: 1) EUA dataset; 2) Telecom dataset. All cases are evaluated on these two datasets respectively. 
* The data pre-processing is implemented by Matlab R2018b and you can find these pre-processing codes on DPP folder.
* This repository does not contain any files or documents of above mentioned datasets, you can download the original datasets form their pages to evaluate and reproduce our experiments.

### Acknowledgement
We really appreciate the authors of EUA and Telecom datasets, their selfless open source spirit help us to conduct our experiments and encourage us to share our codes.
