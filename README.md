# DEUA
A Decentralized Collaborative Approach for Online Edge User Allocation.

### How to run case studies?
The main.py file is the entry programm.

### Datasets
* Our experiments are based on two datasets: 1) [EUA dataset](https://github.com/swinedge/eua-dataset); 2) [Telecom dataset]( http://www.sguangwang.com/TelecomDataset.html). All cases are evaluated on these two datasets respectively. 
* The data pre-processing is implemented by Matlab R2018b and you can find these pre-processing codes on DPP folder.
* This repository does not contain any files or documents of above mentioned datasets, you can download the original datasets form their pages to evaluate and reproduce our experiments.

### Acknowledgement
We really appreciate the authors of EUA and Telecom datasets, their brilliant works help us to conduct experiments and their selfless open source spirit encourage us to share our project.
